The 'Lock & Unlock Levels' is code I was working on to lock and unlock levels as the player progressed in the game but could not get it to work. It was taken from a tutorial which is referenced in the files.

It would have been necessary for me to access the players preferences and saved settings but that part of the game was not fully working and I could not connect to it.

I do not think I could have managed this anyway because this code is written for an older engine than we are using and perhaps not compatible.

I also tried a simpler code but could not make that work either due to not being able to access the player preferences.

Finally I 'thought outside the box' and made a really, really simple workaround using 3 lines of code that was basically copyied into each file to bring up a different scene each time a level was completed... If only I had thought of that in the first place I could have spent my time working on something else.

However I did configure all the graphics, text and some of the music for the 2D scenes apart from 1 which Dorota did.
